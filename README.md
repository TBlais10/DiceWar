# Dice Wars

This project was made durring my edjucation in Careerdevs.
Here we were putting into practice our newly developed skills
in creating fully functioning CLI based applications with
scanners detecting user input and a simple but functioning menu.


## Installation

Install Dice Wars by cloning the repo with Gitbash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TBlais10/DiceWar.git
```

## Usage/Examples

The types of dice games to be played through the menu:

```CLI
. . . . . . 
Ok! Which dice war would you like to play?
1) Standard Dice War
2) Dungeons and Dragons Dice War
. . . . . . 
```

After filling in the short forum, this final message will
appear before starting the game:

```CLI
Ok, lets review!
Number of players: 2
Number of NPC players: 0
Number of Rounds: 4
Type of dice your rolling: D6
The amount of D6: 3
Is this all correct?
 Y to start the game or N to return to restart the form.
```
The game will start:

```CLI
. . . . . . 
Welcome to Dice War! The rules are simple, roll the highest number of dice to win the game! This game will last for 4rounds. May you roll well!
. . . . . . 

. . . . . . 
Round 1!...Out of 4
. . . . . . 

It's Player 1's turn! Press Enter to roll!!!
Input: 
```

Once the game is played, a winner will be displayed and give an
option to return to the main menu and start a new game:

```CLI
. . . . . . 
And our winner for this Dice war is...Player 2 with 34 points! Congratulations!!!
. . . . . . 

Would you like to start a new Dice War?!!! Y/N?
Input: 
```
